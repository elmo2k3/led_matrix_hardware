/*
 * This file is meant to be an extension to the uip Stack.
 * The idea is, to implement an "Application Hub" that routes 
 * incoming data to the right Daemons and Clients, that are 
 * implemented.
 * Each Application has its own Socket-Structure. And all Socket Structures are
 * overlayed in memory internally.
